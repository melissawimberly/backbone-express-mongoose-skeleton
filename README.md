# backbone-express-mongoose-skeleton
This is an extremely minimal skeleton to use with express 4, backbone and mongoose. Doesn't include any tests or task runners, but does include a nice modular file structure to start with.

It uses handlebars for server-side templating but if you want its super easy to change it out with with something else.

Some basic models are included to show how they work if your a noob. Users and basic encryption are included via the node 'crypt' middleware.

Thanks to [guyellis's MEAN repository](https://github.com/guyellis/MEANAppsFiles) for inspiration / great examples of modular structure.
